# Data Structure 

A brief description of what his Data Structure and why we use.



## Tech Stack

**Tool:** vscode

**Language :** python

## Note :
This is Not Language Specified We can use any Language we need here i am using python , u can use whatever u can comfort
  
## Used By
Helps to Solve the Problem in Optimal way 
  
## Acknowledgements
Here we Discuss About DataStructure & Algorithms in Detail way
for vthis we Need To Know About Analysis Of Algorithms 

# Analysis Of Algorithms
In General Analysis Of Algorithm is One of the Important Concept ,
For the  Organization , Getting the Output or Build the Solution is Not Important Concept , The More Important is How Effective Your Code is 
EX : If u went for  the Interview there are 4 people include u , interviewer assign a problem all 4 are solved but in for the Organization they Will Pick One Who Write the code very Effective Way , For This Data Structure & Algorithms are Super Important .

Every Problem Statement has At least 4 Type of Solutions  
Like S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 ….
We Will Pick S2 becozz of the proper  Metrics  compare other 3 , So S2 is the Optimized Solution For the Given Problem

### How will We Say This is the Optimized Solution ?
There are Two Types of Factor To Come To the Conclusion :
1.	Time Complexity
2.	Space Complexity

Time Complexity :
How Much time it takes to Solve my Problem 
We need Minimum Amount Of Time To Get the Result .
Space Complexity:
How Much Space(Memory) Our Code takes to Execute the Result .
We need Minimum Space 

So we Will Denote Asymptotic Notation To Declare Space & Time complexity, help of these Notion (Metrics) We Evaluate Our Code(Solution) How Optimized .


If we Have Two Solution for the Problem with Their own Space & Time Complexity :


Which One we Choose :
 We Will Go with S2 , becozz Tradeoff between Time & Space , People now days have Huge Device with More Spaces but they don’t Have Patience (Time) , So we Will Go With S2

**So In Maximum Time WE will Go For Time Aspect more than Space Aspects**  

**Time Complexity > Space Complexity**

## Types Of Analysis
1.	Apostiary Analysis
2.	Apriori Analysis

Apostiary Analysis: (Relative Analysis)
•	Dependent on the Language of Compiler , and type of hardware we are using .
•	Exact Answer we Get 
•	Every Time we Get Different Answer 
•	Program running fast becozz of hardware efficient.

Apriori Analysis : (Absolute Analysis)
•	Independent of language Of Compiler and type of hardware we using , it is completely different to Previous one .
•	Approximate Result we Get
•	Every Time we Get Same Answer
•	Program Running Fast Becozz of Time Complexity is Less(Good Logic).
We Always Use Absolute Analysis(Aprior Analysis)
So Language and Hardware are not so important for efficient , Good Logic Always the Matter .
